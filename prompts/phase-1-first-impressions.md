# Phase 1: First Impressions

Examine the project as a completely new user would:

1. **What do I see first?**
   - README content
   - Directory structure
   - File names and organization

2. **What claims are made?**
   - Features listed
   - Capabilities promised
   - Status indicators (alpha, beta, stable)

3. **Initial assessment**
   - Does it look professional?
   - Is documentation clear?
   - Are expectations set correctly?

Document your honest first impression. No benefit of the doubt.
