# Phase 2: Installation Test

Follow the README instructions EXACTLY:

1. **Run each command**
   - Copy-paste from README
   - Document errors
   - Note missing deps

2. **What breaks?**
   - Command not found?
   - Import errors?
   - Missing config?

3. **What's missing?**
   - Undocumented setup steps?
   - API keys needed?
   - External services?

Don't fix anything. Just document what fails.
